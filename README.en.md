# JaBOT Al Mossar - Telegram Menu Bot

JaBOT Al Mossar is your daily meal assistant on Telegram! This bot provides a convenient way to access the lunch and dinner menu right in the palm of your hand. It has been lovingly developed in Python and eventually will be hosted on Amazon Web Service to ensure that you and all students can enjoy the delicious meal options anytime.

## How to Use

Follow these simple steps to get started:

1. **Start the Bot**: Open your Telegram and search for "@QxdJabot" or click [here](https://t.me/QxdJabot). Click "Start" to begin receiving daily menu updates.

2. **Receive the Menu**: Every day, JaBOT will send you the menu for both lunch and dinner, directly to your Telegram. It's the perfect way to stay updated on the delicious meal options available.

3. **Custom Commands**: If you want to check the menu at any time, simply type `/lunch` for lunch and `/dinner` for dinner. JaBOT will respond instantly with the latest information.

4. **Stop Updates**: If, for any reason, you want to stop receiving daily updates, simply type `/stop` at any time.

## Technologies Used

This project makes use of the following technologies and libraries:

- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the bot.
- **Selenium**: It automates interaction with the browser to collect menu data.
- **Beautiful Soup (bs4)**: It parses the HTML content of the page to extract information.
